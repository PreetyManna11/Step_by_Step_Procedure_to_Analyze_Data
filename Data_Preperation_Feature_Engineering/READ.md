## Data Preparation - Feature Engineering

### Feature Engineering
Feature Engineering is the creation of new feature to enrich the data using exisiting column.

Suppose you have a column Birth Date of employee working in a company:

So you can calculate Age by subtracting Date and Birth Date so it would be easier to determine the employee's age in such type of scenerios where suppose the stakeholders want to know that what type of employees are working in their company. 

Birth Date | Date | Age
--- | --- | --- |
28/01/97 | 30/08/2023 | 26
01/02/98 | 30/08/2023 | 25


The creation of column/feature is not only restricted while doing data processing. It might happen that you have created new feature. You have done the analysis and while doing the analysis you understood that you might need some extra features so you go back and create new features or you have presented your analysis and you got to know that while presenting at that time as well you can come back and create a new feature and you would have used your feature in the analysis. There is no hard and fast rule that you need to do the data preperation before data analysis only. You can alwyas come back and do it.
