## Data Preperation - Changing Data Format

After Merging the dataset using VLOOKUP function, our next steps is to understand whether our data is in correct format or not.
It is important to make the columns into the right format, Suppose your stakeholders has asked you what is the total annual income of all the customers?
Now imagine if the income column is in text format. In this case, you wont be able to calculate the annual income. You need to change the format in the form of Number.

In order to change the format in Google Spreadsheet -> go to format -> Number -> Automatic 

Automatic -> Usually Google spreadsheet determine the column format properly
But sometimes it can happen that it wont be able to detect the format properly and in that case you can change the format from above process and make it a Number

You can also use TYPE Function in order to know what the format of a cell is.

Now a type function will usually return a numeric value which indicate a specific data type :

1 indicates Numeric
2 indicates Text
4 indicates Boolean
16 indicates Error
64 indicates Array

Note : Excel indicates Date as a Number
