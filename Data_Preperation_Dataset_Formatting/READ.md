## Data Preperation - Dataset Formatting 

After you acquire the Dataset, you need to format your data so that it will be a lot easier for a data analyst to visualize the data. Also it might happen that you need to show the dataset to the stakeholders as well so you need to represent in a good manner.

In order to format your dataset you can do the following steps : 

- Make the First row as Row Header by applying Bold
- Freeze the Header Row so that it will be easier for you to look into the columns if you move further down in your dataset
- Apply border all over your dataset
- If there are any empty rows or columns outside the left side of the dataset
- Apply condition formatting for alternative rows

  There are many more formatting method you can do with your dataset in order to make it look in a represetable format.
