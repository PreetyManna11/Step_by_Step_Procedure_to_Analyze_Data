## Data Processing - Handling Missing Values

Handling missing values is one of the most important steps in Data Analysis Framework. It cannot be very evident whether your analysis will have a direct impact or not but the impact is a bit subtle but that subtle impact itself can change your analysis.

Here we are going to discuss about below questions :
1. Why is it important to handle missing values?
2. How a missing value is represented?
3. How to identify missing values?
4. How to handle missing values?
   
### Why is it important to handle missing values?

There are two reasons behind it :
* Suppose if you are working with some Machine Learning Model, you need to handle missing values properly as it won't work until and unles you provide a complete dataset.
* Let consider from Analysis POV:
Lets say Your stakeholders asked you to calculate Average Income of all the 100 Customers from the given dataset and you have 5 missing values in your dataset in the income column so you went back to the Data Engineering Team/Data collection Team to enquire regarding the missing values and lets consider 2 scenerios regarding what Data Engineering Team/Data collection Team have informed you :

1. Due to some reason they were not able to collect the data.
2. The customers with missing values income is 0. Let's consider 2 cases :
   
   Case 1 : Now in this case suppose if you directly delete these 5 missing values data, in that case you calculate the Average of 95 customer's income.
   
   Case 2 : Now a consider a case where you replace the missing values with 0 and then calculate the Average of 100 customers.

Now if you compare the Average values of Case 1 to Average value of Case 2, Average value of Case 2 is much more smaller than the Case 1 so if you present your analysis infront of stakeholders, it will be quite misguiding. So in order to avoid such mistakes, it's important to handle missing values.


### There are several ways a missing value can be represented : 
* Blanks/Null Values
* Spaces
* Random Value
* Big Value
* Special Character

There can be N no. of possibilities, how a Missing value can be represented.


### How can you identify missing values in the dataset?

* First you need to ask your Data Engineering Team/Data collection team that how is the missing values represented.
* If its represented in the form of Blank/Null Values, You can apply filter to the dataset and check the drop down of the filter to identify whether you have any blank cell in any of the columns.
* You can use COUNTA function to calculate the total no. of filled up cells and then your can calculate the difference between the total no. of cells & the filled up cells in order to get the missing values.
* If it is represented in the form of ten 9's or nine 8's, it will be quite easily be identified using filters.


### How to deal with missing values?

1. Suppose you have a case where you are dealing with data having millions of rows and you have 4-5 missing values and you are not using any machine learning models, in this case you can simply leave as missing values as it is since there are millions of rows and with 4-5 missing values it wont create huge impact.
